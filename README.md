learning-interfaces
===================

Do you want code that's maintainable, extensible, and easily testable? If so, then C# interfaces are here to help. Weâ€™ll take a look at how we can use interfaces effectively in our code -- starting at the beginning ("What are interfaces?") and then exploring why we want to use them. Along the way we'll use existing interfaces, implement own interfaces, and take a look at dynamic loading, unit testing, and dependency injection. All of which is made easier with interfaces.
